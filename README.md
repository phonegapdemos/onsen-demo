# PhoneGap + Onsen UI

Test mobile application built with PhoneGap and Onsen UI framework.

## Includes

This demo contains or includes following things:

_This demo should present all key features of Onsen UI framework, including all available widgets and page themes. Plus it should also contain examples of translation library for multi-language mobile apps and other libraries useful in modern mobile apps development like [meSpeak.js](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/) and others._

## About framework

It is quite huge so can be slow, but it is said to be perfectly tight to PhoneGap, but requires local installation of Cordoba. Onsen UI is based on own tags, not on HTML5 base. It offers 17 page themes ready out-of-the-box, including login and signup pages, and has theme roller (mobile application using it maybe written in base colors set and then changed to destination one at some time). Every example has a direct link to Codepen and it is heavily documented. Onsen UI supports icons from both Font Awesome and Ionicons.

## Important notices

This project can be tested directly in browser with using [Ripple Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc?hl=en). However, project itself is written using [newest PhoneGap API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en), while Ripple Emulator has very old [2.0.0 API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/index.html) behind. Thus, _some parts of this demo will not work in desktop computer browser_. You have to compile it and test it on mobile device, if you want to see all implemented things in action.
